# Righteous Pathway Factor Analysis
Decomposes a set of expressions into a group expression using
factor analysis. The expression regulation can be studied via 
an ANOVA that relates it to the observables in the journal 
file. The final p values are then FDR corrected and the resulting
q values are produced.

The journal and analyte expression file must be ordered
the same way with respect to the samples that are
positioned on the columns.
